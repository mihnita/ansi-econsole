ANSI Escapes in the Eclipse Console
===================================

Eclipse plugin that understands ANSI escape sequences to color the Eclipse console output.

**Marketplace install:**
* In Eclipse select “Help” -> “Eclipse Marketplace...” in the “Find” tab search for “ANSI”<br>
Link: https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/ansi-escape-console<br>
You can of course mark it as “Favorite” to find it easier next time, or on a different machine :-)

**Direct install:**
* In Eclipse select “Help” -> “Install New Software...” and click “Add...” to add the following URL:<br>
`https://www.mihai-nita.net/eclipse`
* You can then select the site in the “Work with” list and continue the installation like with any other plugin.
